# Fret Trainer

This project is a simple fret trainer website, intended to be used as a progressive web application on mobile phones. Obviously, it does function on any platform, but the visuals and design is not necessarily responsive, or at least not in a visually pleasing way :)

**Note:** The project (*v1.3.3*) in its current state was made for my dad for at home use, specifically for iOS, which required some strange solutions, as iOS is not too supportive of progressive web apps. These might be removed when the app is standardized for all platforms in later versions.
